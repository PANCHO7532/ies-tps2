## What is this
Projects that I had to make for some assignment at my school, YEP, the sequel!

## C#? What's that? (required for opening and testing .sln files)
In short, C# is Microsoft's Java... and nothing else.

If you want to use what I used to create these projects, install Visual Studio 2008 from somewhere, or just install the latest Visual Studio from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) and have fun upgrading the projects to the latest version, I didn't use anything fancy (most projects are .NET 3.5 compatible) so you should be golden.

### Is there something useful in here?
Go figure
